# # Encapsulation
# ### Encapsulation in Python
# Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those type of variables are known as private variable.
# 

# - A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions,variables,etc.

# # Did it makes any sense?
# - No
# - That's where encapsulation comes into picture.
# - Now let's see how to encapsulate our code.
# - To do that we have to create a function

# # Setter- to set the values
# # Getter- to get the values

# - There are 3 types of members here public, private and protected
# - The way you declare them shows what type of members they are
# - Even though we declared some members as protected,nothing can stop us from calling them
# 

# - Here the attribute __c can be used to make your attribute private.
# - No keywords like private exists in Python.Whenever you use double underscores it makes your data private.
# - When you use single underscore also it makes it private but nothing can stop you from changing the value of _b or accessing      _b
# - So if you truely want to make your data private please use double underscores in front of your variable.

# - Protected Members (in C++ and JAVA) are those members of the class which cannot be accesssed outside the class but can be accessed from within the class and it's subclasses. To accomplish this in python,just follow the convention by prefixing the name of the member by a single underscore"_".
